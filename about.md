My [web page](http://cypherspace.org)

I am co-founder and CEO of [blockstream](http://blockstream.com).

In 1997, I invented [hashcash](http://hashcash.org) originally as a general proof-of-work system with applications for anti-DoS via the creation of a computationally expensive to create but fast to verify electronic stamp.  Applications included  deterring anonymous remailer DoS, email spam, blog spam, pseudonym name-squatting etc.  Hashcash was proposed for mining by pre-bitcoin ecash systems [b-money](http://www.weidai.com/bmoney.txt) in 1998 by Wei Dai, [bit-gold](http://unenumerated.blogspot.ie/2005/12/bit-gold.html) in 1998 by Nick Szabo and [RPOW](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/finney/rpow/theory.html) in 2005 by Hal Finney and later [Bitcoin](http://bitcoin.org) in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto.
