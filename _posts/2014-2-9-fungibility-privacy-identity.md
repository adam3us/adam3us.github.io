title: Talk on Fungibility, Privacy & Identity
---

Talk at [Tel Aviv Bitcoin meetup](https://www.meetup.com/bitcoin-il/), Feb 2014, on "Fungibility, Privacy & Identity", watch {% include youtube.html id="3dAdI3Gzodo" %} and slides [are here]({{site.url}}/files/fungibility.pdf). 
Take away that counter-intuitively, privacy and fungibility are related but independently configurable properties, plus I argue that identity has no place on the blockchain layer and should be used opt-in where desired, with end to end security, between users at payment protocol layer.
