title: talk on Fungibility, Privacy & Identity
---

Talk at [Tel Aviv Bitcoin meetup](https://www.meetup.com/bitcoin-il/), Feb 2014, on "Fungibility, Privacy & Identity".  
watch [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dAdI3Gzodo) and [slides](fungibility2.pdf). Take away that counter-intuitively that 
privacy and fungibility are related but independently configurable properties, and that identity has place on the blockchain layer.
