title: talk on Fungibility, Privacy & Identity
---

Talk at [Tel Aviv Bitcoin meetup](https://www.meetup.com/bitcoin-il/), Feb 2014, on "Fungibility, Privacy & Identity".  
watch [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dAdI3Gzodo) and [slides]({{site.url}/files/fungibility.pdf). 
Take away that counter-intuitively, privacy and fungibility are related but independently configurable properties, plus I argue that identity has no place on the blockchain layer and should be used opt-in where desired, with end to end security, between users at payment protocol layer.
